    <h1>Timetable</h1>

    <p>When I was in school I was in the habit of using my phone to access my timetable. The frequent room and time changes made paper timetables obsolete.</p>
    
    <p>As such when my school introduced new rules banning phone use within the building, I needed to come up with a new solution.</p>
    
    <p>To fix my problem I built a portable electronic timetable. It could access my updated timetable from the internet, and display it on a small OLED screen, but was small enough to fit easily in my pocket. This served me well as the school had no issue with me using it, and I could always have the most updated version of my timetable.</p>

    <p>To start off with I built a bot that could log onto the school's timetable service - Edumate, and scrape all of my timetable data for me. This took some experimentation but eventually I succeeded using Selenium and some slow painstaking experimentation.</p>

    <p>I already knew I couldn't run this on a microcontroller, or at least not well, so the next step was to design an API which would be hosted online and do the heavy-duty scraping. This API was simple and robust. When it recieved request sent with the correct code it would scrape my timetable and send the day's classes back.</p>
    
    <p>My first prototype was very simple. To reduce wiring I used a Raspberry Pi Pico and an OLED shield with two inbuilt buttons. This was powered by a 5V power bank via the Pico's micro-usb port. The entire assembly was kept within a ziplock bag for protection.</p>

    <p>This prototype worked for a few weeks, but was soon discarded after I built a more permanent prototype: version 2. The second version used the same microcontroller and OLED shield, but had a small rechargable LiPo battery (with corresponding chargin module and 5V supply module) built into the case. This not only saved a lot of space but saved me from dissassembling the device when I wanted to recharge the power bank.</p>

    <p>I laser-cut a case for it which provided more protection than the zip-lock bag and and kept it all within a small box.</p>
